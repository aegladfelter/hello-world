My name is Austin Gladfelter, I am a computer science undergraduate major at Bradley university.
I like to code in Swift and Java.  At Bradley I am concentrating in Mobile App Developement.  
I also have a strong interest in mathematics. I love all types of calculus and differential equations and have found 
a new interest in graph theory and the discrete maths.
